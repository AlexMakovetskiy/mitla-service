Its money is not worth, from the word, at all !!!",

            "text": "I have been to this restaurant quite often, but every time something upsets me. But today, apparently, was the last straw. On previous trips, I encountered such problems as: dirty toilets (I understand that, as it should be according to the standard, it is impossible to wash the bathrooms every 15 minutes, but there was nowhere even to step there); incompetence of the staff (for example, I ordered a spicy chefburger, but they brought the original one) and much more. But today I encountered a real rudeness, moreover, from the manager. I ordered 'to go' and they brought a tray. I asked the manager if this was my order, she said yes. And attention: after I politely asked her to pack my order with me (as it should have been originally), she silently literally threw the bag into my order and left, defiantly showing that 'you collect your order.' I never write reviews, but today's case is the final nail in the coffin. By the way, I don’t know how I didn’t notice (I must have been very dumbfounded by rudeness), but, having opened my order already at home, I found that I had not yet been informed of the cheeseburger. There are no words, only emotions, and mostly negative ones. Terrible restaurant, terrible staff, terrible service. Even one star is too much for this place.",

Well, if they opened 10 minutes later, then it’s understandable, but not to open after 40 minutes, this is already disrespectful to visitors, I would put 3, but since the food is very tasty 4. I hope you solve the problem with opening, because many like and I are traveling from afar, after the road I want to eat, but you don’t open up and thus don’t let you eat :(",

We arrived in Minsk early and wanted to have a bite to eat, but we had to wait for some unknown reason. And it's cold outside now. After we nevertheless got inside the institution, we were immediately warned that the cheeseburger would be no earlier than in 10 minutes. We were completely satisfied with the quality of food and taste. However, there was a surprise with a visit to the toilet. To visit the restroom, you must enter the code that is indicated on the check. A real secret room. The music is playing too loud. The staff is slow. Most of all, I was outraged that the FSC did not open on time.",
